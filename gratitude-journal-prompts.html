                                    <h3 class="text-lg font-medium text-white mb-2">How many gratitude prompts should I answer per day?</h3>
                                    <p>Start with just one prompt per day. Quality matters more than quantity. Once you build consistency, you can expand to 2-3 prompts if you'd like. The key is making it sustainable enough to become a habit.</p>

                                    <p>Start small. Think about basics: clean water, a warm bed, a kind word from someone. Gratitude prompts help by directing your attention to specific areas. Even on hard days, there's usually something small to appreciate.</p>

                                    <p>Yes. Research shows that people who write about gratitude weekly report feeling 25% happier than those who write about problems.

                                    <p>Both morning and evening work well. Morning gratitude sets a positive tone for your day. Evening gratitude helps you reflect and sleep better.
