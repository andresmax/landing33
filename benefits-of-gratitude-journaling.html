                            <h2 class="text-xl font-medium text-white mb-3">1. Reduced Anxiety and Stress</h2>
                            <p class="mb-3">Gratitude journaling shifts your focus from worries to appreciation. When you write about what's going well, your brain produces less cortisol (the stress hormone) and more dopamine and serotonin.</p>
                            <p>A 2021 study found that participants who kept a gratitude journal for just two weeks showed significantly lower levels of anxiety compared to a control group. The effect was especially strong for those with pre-existing anxiety.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Writing about gratitude before bed helps quiet racing thoughts and promotes relaxation. Instead of lying awake worrying, you fall asleep thinking about positive moments.</p>
                            <p>Research published in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research found that grateful people sleep an average of 30 minutes longer and report higher sleep quality. The key is writing for just 5 minutes before bed.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Gratitude journaling is now recommended by therapists as a complement to traditional treatments for depression. It helps break negative thought patterns by creating new neural pathways focused on positive experiences.</p>
                            <p>A study at UC Berkeley found that people who wrote gratitude letters showed significantly better mental health 4 and 12 weeks later, even compared to those who wrote about negative experiences or received counseling alone.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">When you regularly reflect on the people you appreciate, you naturally become more expressive of that appreciation. This creates a positive feedback loop in your relationships.</p>
                            <p>Couples who express gratitude to each other report higher relationship satisfaction. The practice helps you notice and acknowledge your partner's efforts, reducing the tendency to take each other for granted.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">People who practice gratitude regularly bounce back faster from setbacks. By training yourself to find silver linings, you develop a more resilient mindset that helps during difficult times.</p>
                            <p>Research on trauma survivors shows that those who could identify things to be grateful for recovered faster from PTSD symptoms. Gratitude doesn't minimize problems—it helps you cope with them more effectively.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">Gratitude journaling reduces social comparison—one of the biggest threats to self-esteem. When you focus on appreciating what you have, you spend less time envying what others have.</p>
                            <p>Athletes who kept gratitude journals showed increased self-esteem and reduced toxic comparisons to teammates. The practice helps you recognize your own progress and achievements.</p>

                            <p class="mb-3">The mind-body connection means gratitude's mental benefits translate to physical ones. Grateful people report fewer aches and pains and generally feel healthier.</p>
                            <p>Studies show grateful people are more likely to exercise, attend regular checkups, and take care of their health. They also have lower blood pressure and stronger immune function.</p>

                                    <p>Research suggests 2-3 times per week is effective, though daily practice shows stronger benefits.
